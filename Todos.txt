HomePage:
X Clean up top Nav, always thinner version, no story tellers, monkey, menu lines, shop in white text
X Compress the categories line so much thinner like mockup, replace other with Inspired
X Be able to click on feature top post
X Rework post layout with headers, more like first version handed over
X Work in social banner in the post line, bit like http://www.stampd.com at the bottom

Blog Post:
X Movement of page should be like the home page, with content as you scroll down going over bg picture at top
X Softening the text slightly as spoken about?

Menu:
X Make Close just a X, Social links to be icons instead 

Shop:
X 3 Products wide, white background, no price name etc
